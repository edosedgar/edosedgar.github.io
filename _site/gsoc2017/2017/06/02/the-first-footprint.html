    <p>Hello, folks! For a long time I was thinking about an own blog somewhere in the Internet.
Well, I think the time has come. First of all, let me tell you a little bit about myself
and after explain why I have decided to get this one.</p>

<p>So, currently I am a third-year student at MIPT, may be you heard about that university
may be not, do not mind. It is placed near the Moscow and my bachelor program is applied
physics and mathematics. As you can see in the title, my main hobbies are electronics and
a low-level programming. Why? Who knows, it came from my childhood. At the same time it would
be useful to answer the question, what is the hobby? So many men so many minds. However, for me,
it is something which you can do without asking yourself why am I doing it? Yes, the simplicity of genius.</p>

<p>One more interesting topic to be discussed. Why am I writing in English being a Russian?
The best answer â€“ practice makes perfect and compared to Russian writing in English makes me give
careful thoughts and express myself clearer. And, sure, sorry for my poor English if you think so.</p>

<p>And the last one, recently I have been selected as a participant of Google Summer of Code program,
that is why I created a blog, to share progress of development. And now I am working in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strace">Strace</a>
project. My summer goal is to create the Advanced system calls tool for Strace.</p>

<p>Okay, that is enough for today. First evaluations are coming soon, and I am going to post my
progress each Monday. Watch for updates.</p>
